AS Roma's only wins came in 2022, while the remaining matches ended in draws.\n\n**4. Prediction**\n\n* **Calculated Prediction:** Given the current form, H2H record, and Inter's stronger attack, Inter is predicted to win the match. **Prediction: 2 (Inter win)**\n* **Double Chance:** While a Roma win is unlikely, considering their home advantage, a draw remains a possibility. **Double Chance: X2 (Draw or Inter win)**\n\n**5. Goals & Both Teams To Score (GG/NG)**\n\n* **Goals:**  Inter averages more goals and has a stronger attack, making it more likely they will score at least one goal. Roma's defensive strength suggests they might not concede many goals.\n* **GG/NG:** Considering the above, a scenario where Inter scores, but Roma does not, is more likely. **Prediction: NG (No goals from one or both teams)**\n\n**6. Team with Highest & Lowest Probability of Scoring**\n\n* **Highest Probability of Scoring:**  Based on Inter's average goals for and overall attack, the probability of them scoring at least one goal is likely to be well over 70%. \n* **Lowest Probability of Scoring:** Roma's struggles to score consistently and Inter's strong defense indicate a lower probability for Roma to score. This probability could be below 30%.\n\n**Overall:** While AS Roma has the advantage of playing at home, Inter's superior form and dominant H2H record make them the clear favorites.  The match is likely to see a low-scoring affair with Inter scoring at least one goal.  \n\n**Note:** This prediction is based on the provided data and should be considered along with other factors like team news, injuries, and in-game tactical adjustments.\n"
